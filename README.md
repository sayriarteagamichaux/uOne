# uOne

Always be sure you're path is correct (try avoiding spaces or special french characters)


To **clone** this repository, select the folder where "uOne" folder will be created
`git clone <url>`
  
  
Whenever you **start** your work
`git pull origin master`
 (to be sure you pull from the Master branch: `git checkout master`)

To avoid messing up the existing code when **creating a new feature**, create a new branch
`git checkout -b <branch_name>`
(you will notice "master" changed to the name you just choose)
Once you've finished doing all your stuff,
`git add .`
`git commit -am "<type your message>"`
`git push origin <branch_name>`
go to github repository and click on "compare and pull request" and write more details if needed.
Anyone can comment your pull request, you can comment the whole work and even line by line.
You can review the codes here to avoid **conflict** (more info about conflicts https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github/ )
Once the pull request is validated, then all your changes will appear in the master branch.

**That's all folks!**
